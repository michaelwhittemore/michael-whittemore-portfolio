* Should add link to this project and also github, linkedIn, leetCode, resume?, about me mention what tools were built
* Need to look vite.js
* Use netlify or firebase for hosting
* probably should grab a template of some kind
    * Gonna use the hyperspace one I think
* Should I mention I used a template? - shouldn't worry about this right now. Need to remind myself that no one is gonna be going through my code with a fine tooth comb
* https://html5up.net/ has a lot of nice ones
* let's give myself a favicon? Maybe my initials?
* Note that the HTML5 doesn't even have any js/ts
* https://answers.netlify.com/t/serving-static-files-without-framework/82602 - for serving my resume


1. Create a basic skeleton and make sure it's being served 
2. Maybe even draw out a sketch on paper

3. For the template:
    * I think I can get rid of the Sass stuff and all the no script. Also I will only need the index
    * Would like to test the dist if I run build

Maybe copy some stuff from my resume? I want to have a more casual tone?
