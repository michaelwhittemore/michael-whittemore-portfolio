				<h1>Hello, I'm Michael Whittemore.</h1>
				<p> I'm a Bay Area based software developer with five and half years of experience, focused on web and
					real time video communication. I'm a full stack generalist. My past experience on a small team
					required me to wear many hats. I've done everything from API design and implementation, to doubling
					as our team's SDET (both writing automated tests and manually testing across different browsers and
					devices), to working on our CI/CD pipeline and performing deployments, to working with our backend
					architect on piping media to our transcription service, to working on demos and technical
					documentation for our DevRel team. </p>

				<p> I'm an East Bay native and I currently live in Oakland, CA with my technical PM wife, our two cats,
					and our ball python. Some of my non-tech hobbies include live music (primarily metal), boardgames
					(my recent favorites include <a
						href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/418059/seti-search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligence">SETI</a>,
					<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/316554/dune-imperium">Dune: Imperium</a>, and <a
						href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/43015/hansa-teutonica">Hasna Teutonica</a>), and
					classes at my local gym. Most days I can be found working on my personal projects at my local cafe
					alongside many a glass of cold brewed coffee. I always love the opportunity to talk about web
					development or music or
					games.

				<h1>Recent Projects</h1>
				<p>I've taken my layoff as an opportunity to update my skills and work on some personal projects and
					expand and refresh my technical skills. There's a real joy to be found in starting a greenfield
					project. Doing everything from scratch can be slow at times, but I learned a lot and it's very
					satisfying. I like the accessibility of browser games and they remind me of the glory days of flash
					based applications. I always appreciate constructive feedback.

					<h3>Hansa Teutonica <img src="./public/HT_favicon copy.png" class="header-image"></h3>
					<p>Hansa Teutonica is a German Euro-style boardgame. Although it features a heavy amount of
						abstraction, it's surprisingly fast paced and has a substantial amount of player interaction
						compared to its peers. </p>
					<p>Although a digital version already exists, I chose to implement HT in browser as I needed a
						project I felt passionate about after the emotional blow of getting laid off. I chose to work
						with minimal frameworks and tools and use vanilla JS. The game logic all occurs within the
						client, the backend was built with node and express and is responsible for orchestrating room
						creation and player turn messaging. I do all the real time messaging via websockets as I needed
						bi-directional communication between the server and the client.</p>

					<p>The server is hosted in a docker container on Google Cloud Run. I found GCP to be very powerful,
						but frustratingly difficult at times. </p>

					<p> I haven't touched it for a few weeks as it's fully functional right now and a complete game can
						be
						played either offline or with other players. There's a lot of things that could be worked on if
						I
						come back to it in the future. It's not very visually appealing and there's a ton of room for UI
						improvements as I was more concerned with getting an MVP out before touching the user
						experience.
						There's plenty of room for under-the-hood improvements as well, from input validation, to using
						a
						CDN and a bundler instead of serving files directly from my server.</p>


					<p>I feel this project was quite valuable as a learning experience. I learned a lot about the value
						of
						frameworks when working without them; I found myself building my own tools for DOM manipulation
						that
						would have been easily available and thoroughly tested if I had been using a framework. I was
						reminded of the value of documentation for even single dev projects. My single biggest take away
						is
						the importance of building with the future in mind to minimize tech debt. I pushed up a lot of
						hacky
						code early, and it came back to bite me when refactoring.</p>

					<p>I'm always interested in playing a game with real players! </p>

					<h3>Vue Clicker <img src="./public/pickaxe.png" class="header-image"></h3>
					<p> This is an untitled, simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game">
							incremental/idle game</a> build using TypeScript, Vue3, and Vite. I'd wanted to learn a new
						framework and heard good things about Vue, I also wanted to refresh my typescript knowledge. So
						far I love the simplicity of the Vue composition API. Vite also makes setup so much easier -
						it's really nice to be able to quickly build my dist and deploy it via cloudflare workers. </p>

					<p>I'm actively working on this and have a ton more to do. I'm happy with the simple gameplay loop,
						but the beauty of incremental games is their ability to almost infinitely integrate more content
						into a relatively basic gameplay loop. </p>
